Create my first proposal
========================

Quotations are documents sent to customers to offer an estimated price
for a particular set of goods or services. The customer can accept the
quotation, in which case the seller will have to issue a sales order, or
refuse it.

Business case
-------------

For example, my company sells electronic products and my client Agrolait
showed interest in buying 3 iPads to facilitate their operations. I
would like to send them a quotation for those iPads with a sales price
of 320 USD by iPad with a 5% discount.

Configuration
-------------

Install the Sales Management module. In order to be able to issue your
first quotation, you’ll need to install the Sales Management module from
the app module in the Odoo backend.

Discounts on sales order line
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Allowing discounts on quotations is a common sales practice to improve
the chances to convert the prospect into a client.

In our example, we wanted to grant 5% discount to our customer
**Agrolait** on the sale price. To enable the feature, go into the Sales
application, select **Configuration / Settings** and, under Quotations
and Sales, tick Allow discounts on sales order line (see picture below)
and apply your changes.

Create your quotation
---------------------

To create your first quotation, click on Sales / Quotations and click on
Create. Then, complete your quotation as follows:

Customer and Products
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The basic elements to add to any quotation are the customer (the person
you will send your quotation to) and the products you want to sell. From
the quotation view, choose the prospect from the Customer drop-down list
and under Order Lines, click on Add an item and select your product. Do
not forget to manually add the number of items under Ordered Quantity
and the discount if applicable.

If you don’t have any customer or product recorded on your Odoo
environment yet, you can create them on the fly directly from your
quotations :

-  To add a new customer, click on the Customer drop-down menu and click
      on Create and edit. In this new window, you will be able to record
      all the customer details, such as the address, website, phone
      number and person of contact.

-  To add a new product, under Order line, click on add an item and on
      Create and Edit from the drop-down list. You will be able to
      record your product information (product type, cost, sale price,
      invoicing policy, etc.) along with a picture.

Taxes
~~~~~

To parameter taxes, simply go on the taxes section of the product line
and click on Create and Edit. Fill in the details (for example if you
are subject to a 15% taxe on your sales, simply fill in the right amount
in percentage) and save.

Terms and conditions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can select the expiration date of your quotation and add your
company’s terms and conditions directly in your quotation (see picture
below).

-----------------

If you want to see what your quotation looks like before sending it,
click on the Print button (upper left corner). It will give you a
printable PDF version with all your quotation details.

Update your company’s details (address, website, logo, etc) appearing on
your quotation from the the Settings menu on the app switcher, and on
click on the link **Settings / General settings / Configure** company data.
