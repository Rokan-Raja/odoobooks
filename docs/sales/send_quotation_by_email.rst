Send quotation by email
=======================

Quotations are documents sent to customers to offer an estimated price
for a particular set of goods or services. The customer can accept the
quotation, in which case the seller will have to issue a sales order, or
refuse it.

In traditional business process people use to send the quotation by
courier, it is not efficient way as it delayed the negotiation and
