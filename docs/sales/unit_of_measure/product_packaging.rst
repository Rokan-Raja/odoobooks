Selling products in fixed units per package (Packaging)
=======================================================

Business Case
-------------
Assuming that you are a reseller for the Material product, you buy in bulk
(i.e. carton of 1000 units) and sell in the small predefined packages
(i.e. Pack of 12, 24, 48 ...).

You can restrict quantity on the sales order (12, 24, 48), so that it can be sold
only in predefined package size, you are also creating a packages when you deliver
from the warehouse.
