This book is dedicated for entrepreneur who wants to implement all-in-one
business application out-of-the box for their business.
**Odoo Online Book** is an online book written based on Odoo Community and
Enterprise Edition. This book covers best implementation approach for most used
applications such as Sales, Purchase, Inventory, Financial Accounting and Manufacturing.

Why this book?
--------------
After writing `Odoo 10 Implementation Cookbook <https://www.packtpub.com/application-development/odoo-10-implementation-cookbook>`_,
I realized that it is too difficult to have the latest and up-to-date printed
book for each version of the fast evolving software. Odoo release its stable
version every 12 to 15 months.

This book covers the implementation best practices and approach to configure
the business applications out-of-the-box regardless of  Odoo versions.
Each topic on this book try to give solution for the real-life business problem,
follow the configuration steps, some page also shows the video for the configuration steps.

.. note:: Some of the topics on this book give the step-by-step configuration
  through video. You can access all the videos at `Youtube Page <https://www.youtube.com/c/MantavyaGajjar>`_ used on this website.
