Why this book?
--------------
After writing the `Odoo 10 Implementation Cookbook <https://www.packtpub.com/application-development/odoo-10-implementation-cookbook>`_, I realized that it is too difficult to have the latest and up-to-date book for each version of the fast evolving software. Odoo release its stable version every 12 to 15 months.

This book covers the implementation best practices and approach to configure the business applications out-of-the-box regardless of  Odoo versions. Each topic on this book try to give solution for the real-life business problem, follow the configuration steps, some page also shows the video for the configuration steps.

.. note:: Some of the topics on this book give the step-by-step configuration through video. You can access all the videos at `Youtube Page <https://www.youtube.com/c/MantavyaGajjar>`_ used on this website.
